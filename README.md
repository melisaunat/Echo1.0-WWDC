# Echo1.0-WWDC
Welcome to the Echo 1.0! This project brings creative freedom to art gallery viewers, allowing them to interact with an exhibit and generate unique artworks on demand. Users can request customized artwork, generated in real-time and displayed across a screen in the gallery. It’s designed using Processing, making this a versatile, engaging experience in modern visual arts.
# About the Project
The Interactive Art Gallery Project aims to address limited accessibility to diverse artwork experiences by letting viewers generate and explore personalized art pieces. Inspired by the interactive nature of art and creativity, this project opens up endless possibilities by responding to user prompts such as “a pink elephant in Van Gogh’s style.” The artwork generated stays on the screen for 10 minutes, and users can download their creations onto their mobile devices, allowing them to take a piece of the gallery home.
# Project Features
**Real-Time Artwork Generation:** The program instantly generates art based on the viewer’s prompt.

**Multiple Screens:** Art is displayed across 10 screens in a gallery room, creating an immersive experience.

**Download Feature:** Users can download the artwork they generated via their smartphones.
